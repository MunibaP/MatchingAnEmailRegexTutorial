## Description
In this week's challenge, as a transitional web developer I was tasked with creating a regex tutorial. Regular expressions are essential tools for developers, enabling them to define search patterns within strings.This tutorial focuses on understanding a particular regex pattern designed to validate email addresses, breaking down each component to provide a comprehensive understanding of its functionality. Towards the end of this tutorial, you'll have a deeper comprehension of how the regex functions to validate and confirm the entry of a valid email address.    

## User Story
```
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```

## Technologies
The technologies I used in this challenge includes:

1. Github Gist
2. Visual Studio Code(VS-code)
3. Github: Github was used to create a repository which includes all the assets folder, gist tutorial, and the README file.
4. Gitlab: Gitlab was used to clone the project to our laptop.

## Installation
1. To install the challenge#17 , first create a new repository in your Github account, and then clone this repository to your local computer. 
```
To clone: git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git   
```           
2. Login or signup to the Github account.

3. On the GitHub homepage, navigate to the upper-right corner of the page and select the "+" icon, then choose "New gist". Alternatively, you can directly access https://gist.github.com/ to create a new Gist.

4. In the "Gist description" field, enter a brief description of the challenge, such as "Matching an Email Regex tutorial".
 
5. In the "Filename including extension" field, enter a suitable filename and file extension for the challenge. For example, "email_regex_tutorial.md".  

6. In your Github Gist, write a brief explanation of the regex, describing each component and its purpose for your chosen regex.

7. Once completed, create your Gist by clicking on "Create public Gist" or "Create secret Gist" as per your preference. 

## Usage
1. Access the deployed Githib gist link.

2. To utilize the GitHub Gist effectively, read through the introductory paragraph and summary, navigate through the table of contents to explore various sections, and comprehensively understand each component of the regex pattern.

3. Apply the knowledge acquired from this tutorial to enhance and optimize your own projects or challenges, utilizing regex patterns effectively for tasks such as input validation, data extraction, and pattern matching.
